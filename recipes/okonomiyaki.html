    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the okonomiyaki sauce by whisking together the curry powder and Worcestershire sauce. 
                Once the powder is fully dissolved, add ketchup, honey, and oyster sauce. Stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shred cabbage and chop scallions. Put them aside in a large bowl. 
            </li>
            <li>
                For okonomiyaki batter, whisk eggs and dashi together until everything is mixed well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add flour to the egg mixture and stir until there are no large clumps of flour remaining.
                Be careful not to mix too much.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the batter over cabbage and scallions bowl. Add tenkasu and stir together until the ingredients are
                evenly distributed and covered in batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread pork belly strips and evenly dust a thin layer of flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's cook okonomiyaki! Heat a large sized pan over medium-low heat until hot.
                Add oil and pour the okonomiyaki batter into a pile in the center of the pan. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a spatula to shape the okonomiyaki into a thick round pancake and press on the top to compress
                excess air.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the okonomiyaki with pork belly strips. Use the spatula to tuck overhanging pork strips around the edge of Okonomiyaki. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to low and let the okonomiyaki cook for 7-9 minutes or until the side gets browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the bottom side has browned and the okonomiyaki is cooked halfway through, carefully flip it over by using spatula.
                Alternatively, you can cover another pan over it and flip two pans over to flip the okonomiyaki to the other side by using oven mittens or towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the spatula to press the okonomiyaki to ensure even contact with the pan. Continue cooking the okonomiyaki for another
                6 to 7 minutes or until the pork belly has browned up and crispy.
                If you are not using pork belly, ensure the side is browned evenly by adding some oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the okonomiyaki is almost done, tilt the pan to the side and use paper towel to soak up all the excess fat and oil. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the spatula to flip the okonomiyaki once again, and slide it onto a plate. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the top of okonomiyaki with Okonomiyaki sauce. Top with aonori, drizzle of mayonnaise, katsuobushi and pickled red ginger.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve and enjoy!
